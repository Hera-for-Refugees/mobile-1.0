## How to contribute? 
HERA Project is an open-source web platform, currently offered through a mobile application. People can contribute to our codes since it is publicly available. In addition, anyone can use our codes as a base to their interventions for other populations. In addition, interested parties can contribute to HERA in parallel to our 'needs' described in JOGL. Namely, business development, integration and field tests in other populations, P&R material creation and support, UX / UI design. We are also happy to collaborate with organizations and partners for global health / mobile health grant applications. For collaborations, they can contact Aral SÃ¼rmeli through JOGL, or given contact info and discuss how we can work together. The main condition we put forward is that any work related to HERA will be non-profit, meaning the primary aim of any activity will be to improve health of vulnerable populations. We are a group of passionate professionals focused on this aim and always looking for people to share information, guidance and collaboration without any reservation. We are always working on making our work more open for reproductivity and collaboration
